    <h1>Canvas Divider(cDiv)</h1>
    <p>This extension aims to provide a simple way to divide the canvas (or a selection) into equal sections.</p>
    <h1>Basic Usage</h1>
    <p>To begin select cDiv in the Tools tab. If you have a document open, A window should pop up where you can specify your how many divisions to make, as well as whether or not to keep any guides you may already have on the page.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>The <b>Horizontal Guides</b> option specifies how many horizontal divisions should be made.</li>
    <li>The <b>Vertical Guides</b> option specifies how many vertical divisions should be made.</li>
    <li>The <b>Preserve Guides</b> option specifies whether or not to remove pre-existing guides.</li>
    <li>The <b>Border Guides</b> option specifies whether or not to add guides to the borders of your selection. You can add a selection to just the borders by checking this and creating 0 divisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Dividing a Selection </h2>
    <p> If you create a selection before open the dialog, the selection will be divided instead of the entire canvas.
    <h1>Installation</h1>
    <p>To install cDiv, navigate to the releases category and download the most recent release, which should be a zip file. Unpack this zip file into the pyKrita folder in your resources folder. If you are unsure where your resources folder is, open krita and check in settings > configure Krita > general > resources</p>
